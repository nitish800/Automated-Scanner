**Scan All Alive Hosts with [filter-resolved](https://github.com/tomnomnom/hacks/tree/master/filter-resolved) and [Httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe)**

**Separating Cloudflare IPs to Non-Cloudflare IPs**
>It's useless to scan Cloudflare IPs.
>FYI, Install grepcidr first `apt-get install grepcidr`

* Another Vhost Scanner
>Thinking about gobuster or codingo's VHost Scan

* HTML Report
>HTML Reporting Yey :)

* A Param Miner like tool
